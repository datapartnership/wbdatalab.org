The Partnership Day gathered tech companies and international organizations to share insights and field stories about their collaborations for public good. At this year’s Partnership Day, we heard from Sophie Schmidt, Founder and Publisher of “Rest of World," to learn how AI trends were being felt on the ground in developing countries, as well as Dr. Jason Hickey, Google’s Head of Research, who introduced AI-supported tools for social good. Monica Allen, Meta’s Director of Public Policy Campaigns and Programmes, also shared Meta’s current and future plans for translating company data into meaningful social and economic insights.

The event also featured project collaborationg from Meta, LinkedIn, Ookla, JBA, EBRD, OECD, IMF, IDB, the World Bank, and others.
