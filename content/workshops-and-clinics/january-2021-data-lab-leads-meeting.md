We kicked off the Data Lab Leads 2021 meeting series by inviting guest speaker and fellow colleague Joy Aoun to our first board meeting of the new year in January. Joy has been innovating up a storm on finding ways to quickly inform damage and needs assessments in places that are difficult to reach. Drawing upon social media, news, remote sensing and other sources, her team has developed methods that may help improve regular project supervision. We also discussed about onboarding the next tranche of Lab Leads, followed by a round robin.
