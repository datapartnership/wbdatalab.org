The Lab organized a Data Clinic with our Health GP colleagues and Lab memebrs to learn about: (1) WB Health GP priorities for addressing COVID-19 and planned analytical work; (2) Data resources available to Bank staff through the Development Data Partnership (Facebook, Google Health Trends, and MapBox); and (3) Preliminary big data analytics being undertaken by Bank colleagues on different aspects of COVID-19 response.
