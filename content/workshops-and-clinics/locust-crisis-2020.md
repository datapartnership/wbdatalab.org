The Lab organized a Data Clinic (first of its kind) with our Agriculture GP colleagues to brainstorm ideas for tracking and predicting locust swarms, drawing upon the many data resources we have in the Bank. In addition to our Agriculture GP colleagues, colleagues from Climate Change GP, Environment GP, FCV GP, ITS GeoLab, Geospatial Operations and Support Team, DEC Analytics and Tools, DEC Development Data Hub, Development Data Partnership, and WBG Library joined us at the clinic. Together, we defined a clear set of challenges related to the current locust crisis, and we identified analytical methods and resources for addressing these challenges.
