During this event our DEC colleagues, Florina Pirlea and Divyanshi Wadhwa, lead core members of the SDG Atlas team, will give an overview of the SDG Atlas and walk us through the process involved in the making of the Atlas, starting from ideation to the end product.

Following this, Maarten Lambrechts, a member of the data visualization team behind the SDG Atlas 2020, will share insights from the process and technology used to manage and build the Atlas. He will talk about drafting story outlines, writing and editing text collaboratively, sketching visualizations, managing and wrangling data in R, and finally building stories and scrolly visualizations with React, D3, Adobe Illustrator, and Mapbox.
