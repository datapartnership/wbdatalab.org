Edoardo Neerhut and Christopher Beddow from Mapillary will tell us about the resources and features available to the World Bank staff through the Development Data Partnership. They will also talk about Mapillaryâ€™s applications for road surveys and assessment, as well as disaster risk reductions, and OpenStreetMap integrations. And our colleague, Sarah Antos will tell us how her team has been using Mapillary in their projects.
