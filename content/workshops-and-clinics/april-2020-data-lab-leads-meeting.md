In this meeting, we hosted a special clinic for the health global practice on COVID-19 location-based indicators.  We had Bill Hoffman (World Economic Forum), Javier de la Torre (Carto), Alex Pompe (Facebook), Mikel Maron (MapBox), Bo Young Park, and Charlotte Stanton (Google), and Kalev Leetrau (GDELT) present solutions to address the problem, followed by a Round Robin of World Bank colleagues presenting their solutions.
