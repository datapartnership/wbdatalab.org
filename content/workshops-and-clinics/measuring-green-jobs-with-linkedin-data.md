In this session, Karin Kimbrough, Chief Economist at LinkedIn, presented the new measures of green jobs profiles and possible use cases. LinkedIn's team gave an overview of the available dataset and their applications.  
  
The green jobs datasets are an extension of skill and jobs data currently available in the Partnership Portal - it offers measures of green skills, green talent, green jobs, green skills penetration, etc. The datasets are drawn from the anonymized and aggregated profile information of LinkedIn's 770+ million members around the world.
