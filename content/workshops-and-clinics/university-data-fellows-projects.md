In this session, we learned about the University Data Fellows Program and our collaboration with students from the [Cal Poly Digital Transformation Hub](https://dxhub.calpoly.edu/) (DxHub).  We also heard from World Bank colleagues who have worked together on projects about: Traceability of Cacao in Colombia - a collaboration with the Climate Change Fund Management Unit (SCCFM), and Simplifying the Identification of School Infrastructure Vulnerability at Scale - a collaboration with the Global Program for Safer Schools (GPSS).
