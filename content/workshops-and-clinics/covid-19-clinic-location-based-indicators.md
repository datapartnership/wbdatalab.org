Health colleagues asked the Lab to organize an "emergency" clinic to help them narrow down a set of indicators to support social distancing policy formulation. To get started, we invited external partners from Google, Facebook, MapBox, Unacast, and Carto to share the latest progress globally, as well as colleagues from DEC, GFDRR, Poverty, and FCVs to share progress on the Bank’s efforts. With this firehose of a session, we herded cats to mitigate duplication of effort and set a foundation for collaboration.
