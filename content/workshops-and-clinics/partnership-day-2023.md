The Development Data Partnership Day 2023 highlighted how tech companies and international organizations are working together to understand the socio-economic impacts of our most urgent shared challenges -- conflict, natural disasters, food security, pandemic, and climate. Chief Economists, Chief Statisticians, and Chief Data Scientists from tech companies and international organizations shared their insights on how they are collaborating for the public good, and Project Teams and Data Partners presented their impact stories to see the collaborations in action.
