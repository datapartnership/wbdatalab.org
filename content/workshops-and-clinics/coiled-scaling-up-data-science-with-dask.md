In this workshop, we’ll discuss how Dask helps PyData users scale up their computations in exploratory data analysis, data engineering, and machine learning workflows. We’ll also talk about challenges when scaling up to a cluster in terms of networking, performance tuning, package management, and data access. Finally, we’ll walk through a number of interesting use cases with Dask, including an end-to-end workflow with geospatial data.
