Join us on **Thursday, February 9 at 9:30am EST** for a session with Premise to learn more about their sentiment and price monitoring datasets. Leah Taub and Ryan Furey will present datasets from Premise's Tracking Global Events, and other relevant data products such as Premise's Global Index. They will also showcase how these datasets allow insights for real-time decision making.
