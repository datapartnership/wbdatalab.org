**Join us for a workshop on infectious disease catalogs and risk assessment!**

The purpose of this workshop is to introduce infectious disease event catalogs, which are empirical and simulation-derived datasets that can be used to estimate the frequency and severity of past and potential future infectious disease epidemics and pandemics. While event catalogs are widely used in the insurance and actuarial fields and in the study of natural hazards, only recently have the techniques used to create such datasets have been applied to the study of infectious disease, or to associated development challenges.
