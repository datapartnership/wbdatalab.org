**Join us on May 10th, 9:30 a.m. EDT to learn about Facebook's Relative Wealth Index.**   
Facebook recently released "The Relative Wealth Index", which predicts the relative standard of living within countries using de-identified connectivity data, satellite imagery, and other nontraditional data sources. Join Alex Pompe and Laura McGorman from Facebook's Data for Good Team to learn more about the Index, its use cases (e.g., it was used in [Togo for the delivery of cash assistance during COVID-19](https://mcas-proxyweb.mcas.ms/certificate-checker?login=false&originalUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fastcompany.com.mcas.ms%2F90625436%2Fthese-new-poverty-maps-could-reshape-how-we-deliver-humanitarian-aid "https://www.fastcompany.com/90625436/these-new-poverty-maps-could-reshape-how-we-deliver-humanitarian-aid")), and how you can leverage the data for your projects.
