Earth Genome presented its groundbreaking Earth Index platform. Earth Index rethinks environmental monitoring by leveraging large AI foundation models to pre-index terabytes of remote sensing data. Regardless of technical background, this approach enables users to create actionable, locally fine-tuned maps of environmental trends through iterative human-in-the-loop training of custom machine-learning models. Earth Index's practical applications are numerous, from tracking gold mining in the Amazon to uncovering previously unmapped Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) in the American South.
