title = "SpaceX: How Starlink Broadband From Space Is Equalizing Internet Access"
workshop_types = ["workshops"]

+++
In this session, SpaceX presented how Starlink is already changing lives across the globe through access to high-quality broadband in the most rural and unserved areas.

Connectivity is a foundation to improve communities and bridge the digital divide, and Starlink has already supported natural disaster recovery responses, education, healthcare, agriculture, and economic development use cases.

Spacelink and SWARM - a recent SpaceX acquisition that focuses on satellite connectivity for remote IoT devices - bring the technology solutions for connectivity no matter where in the world or what the project may be.
