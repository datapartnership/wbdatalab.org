        <h1>Data Corps</h1>
          <p class="data-corps-description">
            As data availability and analytical methods rapidly advance, World Bank operations and research teams are increasingly seeking data-related support -- alternative data acquisition, modern data science and geospatial analytical methods, and web-based dissemination solutions. Where is a Bank colleague to begin? 
            <br><br>
            The Data Corps is a registry of staff and STCs who: (i) have passed at least on World Bank Skill Certification exams; and (ii) have voluntarily opted into the registry to signal their availability and interest in providing cross-support.   
            <br><br>
            Task teams benefit by drawing upon a wide pool of colleagues from across the Bank, quickly finding the right fit at the right time.  Data Corps members get to build their portfolios, using their skills to solve a range of challenges, all while building critical social and technical networks between units and teams. 
            <br><br>
