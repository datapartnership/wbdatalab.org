        <p class="data-fellows-description">
          The World Bank has streamlined university partnerships through use of ​
          a standard framework agreement, designed to cover many different​
          kinds of student projects and engagements. As specific projects and​
          collaborations are initiated, these are added to the signed framework​
          agreement.
        </p>
        <p>World Bank staff are invited to submit project proposals to university​
          partners, who then select and match projects to students / student​
          teams. Proposals will cover a wide range of public service and​
          infrastructure challenges in emerging economies. All will have a​
          geospatial and/or data science component suitable for graduate-level data and computer science students.​</p>
        <p>While students’ time are covered by their university, Bank staff will reimburse students and their advisors
          for any expenses directly associated with their project (e.g., travel). ​
          To receive information about the next call for proposals, or to recommend a new university for the program,
          drop us a note: <a href="mailto:datalab@worldbank.org!">datalab@worldbank.org!</a>​</p>
