Further, the Research Librarians provide a free and invaluable service, identifying datasets that can support your project.</p><h3>World Bank Development Data Hub</h3><p>The World Bank's internally facing data catalogue includes both public and Official Use Only data pulled from: the open data catalogue, micro-data catalogue, World Development Indicators, Statistical Performance Indicators, Geospatial Library, and others.</p><h3><a href=https://datapartnership.org>Development Data Partnership</a></h3><p>The Development Data Partnership catalogue includes pro-bono private sector data available to staff, from companies including Google, LinkedIn, Meta, Planet, and others.</p></div></div><div class=directory-text><div class=directory-heading><h1>Community</h1><p>What is better than a good data scientist? More than one! Data science is about finding creative mathematical ways to solve problems, and the bigger the problem, the more likelihood of success when we work together. But how to find your tribe?</p><h3>Data Corps</h3><p>Looking for a World Bank collaborator with specific (and certified) data skills? Try the Data Corps repository - a list of colleagues who have received World Bank Data Skills certifications and have opted into the Corps registry to signal their interest and availability for cross-support opportunities and collaborations.</p><h3>Data Lab Community</h3><p>Want to find opportunities to network with other data enthusiasts and keep up with the latest? Sign up for the Data Lab mailing list and start joining our community events, both in-person and remote.</p><h3>Data Leads</h3><p>Within each of the ~120 directorates in the World Bank, there is a nominated Data Lead – a team resource who can advise on all things related to data resources in the World Bank. How do they do this? Through training and being part of a strong Data Leads network. Interested in becoming a Data Lead?

The Lab is working hard to make World Bank code more consistent, reusable, and discoverable.</p><h3>code.worldbank.org</h3><p>Conducting data analytics and have the feeling this may have been done before? Check out code.worldbank.org (beta) for reusable code modules that your fellow colleagues have contributed to Bank operations - lending, economic reporting, and technical assistance.</p><h3>WB Data Science Template</h3><p>WB Data Science Template.
